This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How to run the project

First, make sure you have Node installed. This app needs Node in order to run.
If you're not a dev, simply run:

### `Run.bat`

You can find this file on the top level of the project directory.

If you ARE a dev, first run:

### `npm i`

This installs the dependencies you'll need for this project. Unless you install more dependencies, you should only have 
to run that once. After this is finished running, do:

###`npm start`

This runs the app in the development mode.<br>
The webpage should open automatically after you run this, but if it doesn't....<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console. <br>
Alternatively, you may see some errors on the webpage itself.

## Project usage and known bugs

This is a beta version of the project. As such there is some incomplete/missing functionality:

- Searching for friends is not yet functional
- All example wishlist items are the same
- Not all input fields in Add Item and Add Event have verification
- There are some issues with added Events/Items not showing up on their respected pages
- There is no persistence
- The logo is a cardboard box

The website should otherwise work as intended.
